	<h3>Verse</h3>
	<p style= "margin-left: 2px; margin-right: 4px">	Hello, it's me
		I was wondering if after all these years you'd like to meet
		To go over everything
		They say that time's supposed to heal ya, but I ain't done much healing
		Hello, can you hear me?
		I'm in California dreaming about who we used to be
		When we were younger and free
		I've forgotten how it felt before the world fell at our feet
	</p>
	<h3>Chorus</h3>
	<p style= "margin-left: 4px; margin-right: 4px">
		Hello from the other side
		I must've called a thousand times
		To tell you I'm sorry for everything that I've done
		But when I call, you never seem to be home
		Hello from the outside
		At least, I can say that I've tried
		To tell you I'm sorry for breaking your heart
		But it don't matter, it clearly doesn't tear you apart anymore
	</p>
